= Building Groovy Libraries

This guide demonstrates how to create a http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] library in the standard form using Gradle's Build Init plugin.

== What you'll need

* About +++<span class="time-to-complete-text"></span>+++
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or higher
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better

== Check the user manual

Gradle comes with a built-in plugin called the Build Init plugin. It is documented in the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_init_plugin.html[Gradle User Manual]. The plugin has one task, called `init`, that generates the project. The `init` task calls the (also built-in) `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`.

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing]
----
$ mkdir building-groovy-libraries
$ cd building-groovy-libraries
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task with the `groovy-library` argument.

[listing]
----
$ gradle init --type groovy-library
include::{gradle-outdir}/initOutput/out.txt[]
----

The `init` task runs the `wrapper` task first, which generates the `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` wrapper scripts. Then it creates the new project with the following structure:

[listing]
----
include::project-structure.txt[]
----
<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Default Groovy source folder
<3> Default Groovy test folder

== Review the generated project files

The `settings.gradle` file is heavily commented, but has only one active line:

.Generated settings.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{gradle-outdir}/files/settings.gradle[]
----
<1>  This assigns the name of the root project.

The generated `build.gradle` file also has many comments. The active portion is reproduced here (note version numbers for the dependencies may be updated in later versions of Gradle):

.Generated build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{gradle-outdir}/files/build.gradle[]
----
<1> Public Bintray Artifactory repository
<2> Groovy version that this project will include as dependency
<3> Spock Framework testing library
<4> JUnit testing library

The build file adds the `groovy` plugin. This is an extension of the `java` plugins and adds additional tasks for compiling Groovy source code. It also allows for joint compilation of Groovy and Java files if found in the appropriate `groovy` source folders.

The file `src/main/groovy/Library.groovy` is shown here:

.Generated src/main/groovy/Library.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
include::{gradle-outdir}/files/src/main/groovy/Library.groovy[tags=source-code]
----

The generated Spock specification, `src/test/groovy/LibraryTest.groovy` is shown next:

.Generated  src/test/groovy/LibraryTest.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
include::{gradle-outdir}/files/src/test/groovy/LibraryTest.groovy[]
----

The generated test class has a single http://spockframework.org[Spock specification]. The test instantiates the `Library` class, invokes the `someLibraryMethod` method, and checks that the returned value is `true`.

== Execute the build

To build the project, run the `build` task. You can use the regular `gradle` command, but when a project includes a wrapper script, it is considered good form to use it instead.

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew build
include::{gradle-outdir}/buildOutput/out.txt[]
----

NOTE: The first time you run the wrapper script, `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

The first time you run the build, Gradle will check whether or not you already have the Groovy, Spock Framework and JUnit libraries in your cache under your `~/.gradle` directory. If not, the libraries will be downloaded and stored there. The next time you run the build, the cached versions will be used. The `build` task compiles the classes, runs the tests, and generates a test report.

You can view the test report by opening the HTML output file, located at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

A sample report is shown here:

Congratulations, you have just completed the step from creating a Groovy library! You can can now customise this to your own project needs.

== Adding API documentation

The `groovy` plugin has built-in support for Groovy's API documentation tool `groovydoc`.

Annotate the `Library.groovy` file with Groovydoc markup.

.src/main/groovy/Library.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
include::{gradle-outdir}/files/src/main/groovy/Library.groovy[tags=groovy-doc]
----

Run the `groovydoc` task.

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew groovydoc
include::{gradle-outdir}/docOutput/out.txt[]
----

You can view the generated Groovydoc by opening the HTML file, located at `build/docs/groovydoc/index.html`.

== Summary

You now have a new Groovy project that you generated using Gradle's build init plugin. In the process, you saw:

* How to generate a Groovy library
* How the generated build file and sample Groovy files are structured
* How to run the build and view the test report
* Generating API documentation.

== Next Steps

* Read about the {user-manual}groovy_plugin.html[Groovy Plugin]
* Get to know the configurations for the {language-reference}org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.GroovyCompile.html[GroovyCompile] and {language-reference}org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Groovydoc.html[Groovydoc] task types.
